· Based on Workshop 1, I used `setInterval(colorBalloons, 1000)` to execute the `colorBalloons` function every second, which updates the balloon count at regular intervals.
· I added `mousePressed`, which resets `balloonCount` and `counter` to 0 when the user clicks the mouse. This is done to restart the balloon generation process, rather than continuing to increase from the previous count.

I removed Stroke() and added noSmooth(). You can see that the circle has a black border, but the jagged effect is not noticeable, so I changed the size of the circle to a smaller size as well.
