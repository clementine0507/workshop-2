# workshop-2
I added the content of workshop 2 to the previous task and included logs for easier memory.

### reflection
I tried to add interactivity to the balloon based on an assignment, so I added the same functions as in Workshop 2. At first, my functions didn’t work, so I asked ChatGPT to help me check the code. The reason is that I hadn’t defined ‘balloonCount’.
